# Labwork1 

Objective of the work: to study basic concepts (classes, subclasses, and methods). Implement fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

Task:
Create a description of a class for vector objects defined by coordinates of endpoints in three-dimensional space. Provide operations for vector addition and subtraction to obtain a new vector (sum or difference), calculation of the scalar product of two vectors, vector length, and cosine of the angle between vectors. Write a program demonstrating the class's functionality, including a menu for testing all class methods.

During this laboratory work, I studied fundamental concepts (classes, subclasses, and methods) and learned to implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. I explored the methodology of constructing UML diagrams and tried applying it in practice.
